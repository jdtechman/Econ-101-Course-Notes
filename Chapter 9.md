<h1 id="chapter-9-possibilities-preferences-and-choices">Chapter 9 Possibilities Preferences and Choices</h1>
<h2 id="consumption-possibilities">Consumption Possibilities</h2>
<p>Consumption choices are limited by household income and prices. As described in chapter 8, the budget line describes the limits to a households spending choices. Any number of choices to spend a household income is known as a consumption choice</p>
<h3 id="divisible-and-indivisible-goods">Divisible and Indivisible Goods</h3>
<p>Divisible goods can be bought in any quantity desired, such as gasoline and electricity.<br>
An easier way of understanding household choices is if you assume all goods are divisible, i.e. a person who watches 1 movie every 2 months watches 0.5 movies per month. The continuous budget line is when all goods are divisible.<br>
Indivisible goods are goods that can not be bought in any quantity desired, i.e. 3/4 of an apple at a grocery store.</p>
<h3 id="affordable-and-unaffordable-quantities">Affordable and Unaffordable Quantities</h3>
<p>Quantities at or below a budget line are affordable, above are unaffordable<br>
The constraint on consumption depends on income and prices, to illustrate how changes in either affect the choices someone makes we will use a budget equation</p>
<h3 id="budget-equation">Budget Equation</h3>
<p>We can describe the budget line using a budget equation. The budget equation starts witht he fact that <em>Expenditure = Income</em><br>
For two goods m and p the expenditure is equal to<br>
<em>P<sub>m</sub> Q<sub>m</sub> + P<sub>p</sub> Q<sub>p</sub></em> where <em>P</em> is the price of a good and <em>Q</em> is the quantity purchased of a good. Call the income <em>Y</em> and the budget line is now <em>P<sub>m</sub> Q<sub>m</sub> + P<sub>p</sub> Q<sub>p</sub> = Y</em> This can easily be manipulated for either of the variables to show the budget line, where <em>Income</em> is the Y-intercept of the line<br>
For example isolating for quantity of good p we get: *Q<sub>p</sub> = Y/P<sub>p</sub> - (P<sub>m</sub>/P<sub>p</sub>)Q<sub>m</sub><br>
From this equation there are to important variables <em>Y/P<sub>p</sub></em> and <em>P<sub>m</sub>/P<sub>p</sub></em><br>
These are known as the <em>real income</em> and the <em>relative Price</em> respectively</p>
<h4 id="real-income">Real Income</h4>
<p>This is the income of a household expressed as the quantity of one good a household can buy. <em>Y/P<sub>p</sub></em> is the maximum units of p a household can buy, and purchasing anything else costs a household in quantity of p. This is the y-axis of the budget line</p>
<h4 id="relative-cost">Relative Cost</h4>
<p>This is the price of one good divided by the price of another. This is also equal to the <em>oppurtunity cost</em> of the goods. It is also the slope of the budget line.</p>
<h4 id="a-change-in-price">A change in Price</h4>
<p>When prices change, so does the budget line. The lower the price of the good that is measured on the x-axis, the flatter the budget line is (<em>P<sub>1</sub>/P<sub>2</sub></em> is the slope and <em>P<sub>1</sub></em> decreases, the slope is less steep) if the good on x-scaleâ€™s price increases the slope will increase and the budget line becomes steeper.</p>
<h4 id="a-change-in-income">A change in Income</h4>
<p>A change in money income produces a change in real income but <em>does not</em> change the relative price of goods, so it only changes the y-intercept of the budget line. Therefore an increase income shifts the budget line rightwards, and a decrease shifts it leftward.</p>
<h2 id="preferences-and-indifference-curves">Preferences and Indifference Curves</h2>
<p>Indifference Curve is a line that shows combinations of goods among which the user is indifferent. Any point along an indifference curve satisfies the consumer as much as another point on it. A preference map is a series of indifference curves that resemble contour lines on a map. By looking at the shape of indifference surves we can draw conclusions about a persons preferences.</p>
<h3 id="marginal-rate-of-substitution">Marginal Rate of Substitution</h3>
<p>The <em>Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)</em> is the rate at which a person will give up good y to get an additional unit of good x. It is measured by drawing a tangent line at any point on an indifference curve.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the indifference curve is steep the marginal rate of substitution is <em>high</em>, the person will give up a large quantity of good x to get an additional unit of good y while remaining indifferent</li>
<li>Vice versa if slope is flat<br>
This shows dimnishing marginal rate of substitution as the indifference curve is bowed inwards, and starts steep but ends shallow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="degree-of-subtsitutability">Degree of Subtsitutability</h3>
<p>Two ordinary (normal) goods would have a bowed indifference curve.</p>
<h4 id="close-substitutes">Close substitutes</h4>
<p>The closer substitutes two items are the less bowed an indifference curve is<br>
The indifference curves for perfect substitutes are straight lines sloping downward.</p>
<h4 id="complements">Complements</h4>
<p>The closer to being perfect complements two items are the closer the marginal rate of substitution is to being a constant and the more bowed an indifference curve is.<br>
The indifference curves for perfect complements look like an L</p>
<h2 id="predicting-consumer-choices">Predicting Consumer Choices</h2>
<h3 id="best-affordable-choice">Best Affordable Choice</h3>
<p>The best affordable choice is a point in which all income is spent, and the consumer is on their highest attainable indifference curve<br>
This is shown as the point a consumers budget line crosses its highest indifference curve</p>
<h4 id="on-the-budget-line">On the Budget Line</h4>
<p>The best affordable point is on the budget line, as every point inside the budget line there are points on the line that the consumer prefers.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-highest-attainable-difference-curve">On the highest attainable difference curve</h4>
<p>Every point on the budget line occurs on an indifference curve, the highest indifference curve on the budget  (the one making the consumer the most happy) will therefore be the best affordable choice</p>
<h4 id="marginal-rate-of-substitution-equals-relative-price">Marginal Rate of Substitution equals Relative Price</h4>
<p>At the best affordable choice the MRS equals the relative price, which means the slope of the budget line is equal to the slope of the indifference curve at that point</p>
<h3 id="a-change-in-price-1">A Change in Price</h3>
<p>The <em>Price Effect</em> is the effect of a change in price of a good on the quantity of goods consumed</p>
<p><em>Recall: an increase in price of the good on the x-axis of the budget line steepens the slope of the budget line (Relative Price up) vice versa for decrease in price</em></p>
<p>When the price of good x falls and the price of good x falls and the price of good y and income stays the same, the consumer will buy more of good x and less of good y (substitute more of x for y)</p>
<h4 id="the-demand-curve">The Demand Curve</h4>
<p>In Ch 3. it was asserted that demand curves slope downward, we can now derive this using a consumers budget line and their indifference curves. By doing this we can see the law of demand and the downward slope are consequences of a consumer choosing their best affordable combination of goods.</p>
<p>To derive a demand curve Lower the price of good x and find the consumers best affordable choice at different prices. This will result in a downwards sloping curve, the lower the price of good x, the more of good x a consumer consumes, this is the law of demand.</p>
<h3 id="a-change-in-income-1">A Change in Income</h3>
<p>the <em>income effect</em> is the effect of a change in income on buying plans.</p>
<p><em>Recall: an increase in income moves the budget line to the right (increases the y-axis) and a decrease in income moves the budget line to the left (decreases the y-axis)</em></p>
<p>If when income falls the best affordable choice falls as well then the good is anormal good.</p>
<p>If when income raises the best affordable choice falls then the good is an inferior good</p>
<h4 id="the-demand-curve-and-the-income-effect">The Demand Curve and the Income Effect</h4>
<p>When income lowers the demand curve shifts left, as the best affordable point for normal goods at the same price will decrease. Vice versa for increase in income</p>
<h3 id="substitution-effect-and-income-effect">Substitution Effect and Income Effect</h3>
<p>For a normal good, a fall in price <em>always</em> increases the quantity bought. We can prove this by dividing the price effect into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Substitution Effect</li>
<li>Income Effect</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-substitution-effect">The Substitution Effect</h4>
<p>The substitution effect is the effect of a change in price on the quantity bought when a consumer (hypothetically) remains indifferent between the original situation and the new one.</p>
<p>What this means, is when the price changes keep the consumer on the same indifference curve as the previous best affordable choice, this will look like it has the effect of lowering the consumers income.</p>
<p>The direction of the substitution never changes, when the relative price of a good falls, the consumer substitutes more of that good for the other good.</p>
<h4 id="the-income-effect">The Income Effect</h4>
<p>The substitution effect had the consequence of giving the consumer a decrease in income given by X (allowing them to stay on the same indifference curve) to calculate the income effect we give the consumer increase the consumers income by X.  This will shift the consumers budget line outwards <strong>BUT</strong> will not change the slope of their budget line. This will change the best affordable choice to one on a different indifference curve.<br>
As the consumers income increases they will see more of a normal good, and the income effect reinforces the substitution effect. Because they work in the same direction, we can be sure that the demand curve slopes downwards.</p>
<h4 id="inferior-goods">Inferior Goods</h4>
<p><em>Recall an Inferior good is a good for which demand decreases when income increases</em></p>
<p>For an inferior good the income effect is negative.</p>
<p>The substitution effect of a fall in price still increases the quantity demanded, but the negative income effect works in the opposite direction and offsets the substitution efect to some degree. The question is in the degree of offset.</p>
<ul>
<li>When negative income effect <em>equals</em> positive substitution effect, a fall in price leaves quantity bought the same</li>
<li>When negative income effect is <em>less than</em> the positive substitution effet, a fall in price increases the quantity bought, and the demand curve still slopes down like a normal good, <strong>BUT</strong> the inferior goods demand may be less elastic than an normal good</li>
<li>When negative income effect <em>is greater than</em> the positive substitution effect than the fall in price decreases the quantity bought and the demand curve slopes upwards. This does not happen in the real world</li>
</ul>
