## Economic Cost and Profit

### Economic Accounting
Economists measure a firm's profit to enable them to predict the firm's decisions, and the goal of the decisions is to maximize economic profit

*Economic Profit* is equal to total revenue minus total cost, with total cost measured as the oppurtunity cost of production.

### A Firm's Oppurtunity Cost of Production
A firm's oppurtunity cost of production is the value of the best alternative use of the resources that a firm uses in production.
Can be broken down in to thefollowing costs of using resources:
* Bought in the market 
* Owned by the firm
* Supplied by the firm's owner
#### Bought in the Market
the firm could have bought different resources to produce some other good or service

#### Owned by the Firm
 If the firm owns capital and uses it to produce its output then it incurred an oppurtunity cost (it could have sold it to other firms), the firm implicitly rents the capital from itself, and this is known as the *implicit rental rate of capital*
 
 Implicit rental rate of capital is made up of 
 1. Economic depreiciation --> the change in the *market value* of capital over a given period
 2. Interest forgore --> return on funds used to acquire the capital

#### Resources Supplied by the Firm's Owner
The owner may supply both entrepeneurship and labour, the return to entrepeneurship is profit, and the profit the the entrepeneur can expect to receive on **average** is *normal profit*
(normal profit is the cost of entrepeneurship and is an oppurtunity cost)

## Decision Time Frames
To sturdy the relationship between a firm's output decision and its costs we distinguish between two time frames:
 * The short run
 * The long run

 ### The short run
 
 the short run is a time frame in which the quantity of at least one factor of production is fixed.
 the fixed factors of production is known as *The plant* 
 To increase output in the short run, a firm must increase the quantity of a variable factor of production.
 These decisions are easily reversed.
 
 ### The long run
 
 the long run is a time frame in which the quantity of all factors of production can be varied. 
 To increase output in the long run, a firm can change its plan as well as the dynamic factors.
 Long run decisions are **not** easily reversed, and once a plant decision is made the firm must live with it for a long time. 
 The *sunk cost* is the past expenditure on the plant that has no resale value.
 A sunk cost is irrelevent to the firms current decisions, and the only relevent costs are short-run costs of changing labor input and long-run costs of changing the plant.

## Short Run Costs
To produce more output in the short run, a firm must employ more labour, which will increase costs. 
We describe the relationship between output and cost with three cost concepts:
* Total Cost
* Marginal Cost
* Average Cost
* 
### Total Cost

A firms total cost (TC) is the cost of *all* the factors of production it uses. We seperate this into total fixed cost (TFC) and total variable cost (TVC). TFC is the cost of the firms fixed factors, and TVC is the cost of the firms variable fastor. 
*TC = TFC + TVC*

### Marginal Cost

the increase in total cost that results from a one-unit increase in output is the *marginal cost* (MC) 
At small outputs the MC decreases as output increases because of greater specialization and the division of labour, but as output increases further eventually MC increases because of the *law of diminishing returns* .
MC tells us how total cost changes as output increases

### Average Cost

There are three average costs of production
* Average Fixed Cost (AFC)
* Average Variable Cost (AVC)
* Average Total Cost (ATC)
These are defined as total (fixed|variable)\* cost per unit of output 
recall: *TC = TFC +TVC*
to get average divide by quantity produced Q
*TC/Q = TFC/Q +TVC/Q* --> *ATC = AFC + AVC*

### Marginal Cost and Average Cost
The MC curve intersect the AVC and ATC curve at their minimum points, this is because when MC > AC, AC is increasing, this holds for both AVC and ATC curves. 

### Why the Average Total Cost Curve is U-Shaped

It arrises from two opposing forces
* Spreading total fixed cost over a larger output
* Eventually Diminishing Returns
When output increases the firm spreads its total fixed cost over a larger output and so its AFC decreases- AFC slopes downward
Eventually diminishing returns will mean that a larger amount of labour is needed to produce one more output, this will eventually overtake the decrease that is from the AFC curve's downward slope and will make the MC slope upwards. 

### Shifts in the Cost Curves
The position of a firm's short run cost curve depends on two factors:
* Technology
* Prices of Factors of Production
A techonological change that increases productivity increases the marginal product and average product of labour. With better tech, the same factors of production can produce more output. This will have the effect of shifting the cost curves down, while shifting the product curves up.

An increase in the price of a factor of production increases the firms costs and shifts its cost curves. The shift depends on which factor's price changes. An increase in rent or some other fixed cost shifts the TFS and AFC curves upwards (increasing TC curve) but leaves TVC and AVC curve unchanged. Similarly if labour or other variable costs go up (TFS and AFC unchanged TVC and AVC go up).   

## Long Run Cost
In the long run a firm can vary both the quantity of labour and the quantity of capital, so in the long run, all the costs are variable. The behaviour of long-run cost depends on the firms *production function* which is the relationship between the maximum output attainable and the quantities of both labour and capital.
### The Production Function
The production function is a table that has various plant sizes, and their output depending on labor (Just see slides for this)

#### Diminishing Returns

Diminishing returns occur within each of the plant sizes studied as the quantity of labor increases.

#### Diminishing Marginal Product of Capital
The *marginal product of capital* is the change in total product divided by the change in capital when the quantity of labour is constant -- equivalently the change in output resulting from a one unit increase in the quantity of capital.

### Short Run Cost and Long Run Cost
Changing the plant has a large effect on the ATC in the short run.
Things to note about different plant sizes:
1. Each short run ATC curve is U-Shaped
2. For each short run ATC curve the larger the plant, the greater the output at which ATC is at a minimum

The minimum ATC for larger plants occurs at a greater output than it does for a smaller plant as it has a higher total fixed cost, and therefore for any given output a higher AFC.

Which short run ATC curve a firm operates on depends on the plant it has, in the long run the firm can choose the plant, and the plant it chooses is the one that enables it to produce its planned output at the lowest ATC.

When a firm is producing a given output at the least possible cost, it is operating on its long-run average cost curve. the *long-run average cost curve* is the relationship between the lowest attainable ATC and output when the firm can change both the plant it uses and the quality of labor it employs.

### The Long-Run Average Cost Curve (LRAC)
The curve is the combination of the best short run average cost curves for any given output. 

### Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
*Economies of scale* are features of a firm's technology that make average total cost **fall** as output increases. When economies of scale are present the LRAC slopes downwards.  
Greater specialization of both labour and capital is the main source of economies of scale.
*Diseconomies of scale* are features of a firm's technology that make average total cost **rise** as output increases. When diseconomies of scale are present the LRAC  slopes upwards. 

*Constant returns to scale* are features of a firm's technology that keep average total cost constant as ourput increases, in this case the LRAC is horizontal.

#### Minimum Efficient Scale
A firm's *minimum efficient scale (MES)* is the *smallest* output at which long-run average cost reaches its lowest level.
This has a role in detemrining market structure. If MES is small relative to demand, then there is room for a large number of firms. If MES is large relative to demand then only a small number (or even one) can make a profit in the market, and it is therefore either a monopoly or oligopoly.
