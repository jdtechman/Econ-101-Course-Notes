<h1 id="chapter-8-utility-and-demand">Chapter 8 Utility and Demand</h1>
<h2 id="consumption-choices">Consumption Choices</h2>
<p>The choices a buyer of goods makes are influenced by many factors but can be summarized by the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption Possibilities</li>
<li>Preferences</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consumption-possibilities">Consumption Possibilities</h3>
<p>Consumption possibilities are all of the things you can afford to buy<br>
They are limited by your income and by the price of the good</p>
<h4 id="a-consumers-budget-line">A Consumers Budget Line</h4>
<p><strong>Budget Line</strong> – The consumers budget line is the boundary between combinations of goods and services a household can buy, and those it can’t. (What is affordable and what is not)<br>
Note: any combination on <strong>or</strong> <em>below</em> the boundary is affordable, and anything <em>above</em> in unaffordable<br>
The <em>budget line</em> shows what it is possible, while <em>preferences</em> determine what possibility is chosen</p>
<h4 id="changes-in-consumption-possibilities">Changes in Consumption Possibilities</h4>
<p>Consumption possibilities change when income or prices change<br>
An <strong>Increase</strong> in income shifts the budget line outwards while a <strong>Decrease</strong> shifts it inwards while leaving the slope of the budget line <strong>Unchanged</strong><br>
A change in price does <strong>Not</strong> shift the budget line in or out, but it <strong>changes</strong> the slope of the line.</p>
<h3 id="preferences">Preferences</h3>
<p>A buyer’s income and the prices of services and goods limit their consumption choices, but there is still choice. The choice they buyer ends up making will depend on their <em>preferences</em>, which is a description of their likes and dislikes<br>
Marginal Benefit and Marginal Benefit Curve are ways of describing preferences.<br>
We want to explain <em>What determines demand and marginal benefit</em><br>
One way of determining that is through the use of utility<br>
<strong>Utility</strong> – The benefit or satisfaction that a person gets from the consumption of goods and services<br>
There are two main utility concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Utility</li>
<li>Marginal Utility</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="total-utility">Total Utility</h4>
<p><strong>Total Utility</strong> – the total benerfit that a person gets from the consumption of all the different goods and services<br>
More consumption generally gives more total utility</p>
<h4 id="marginal-utility">Marginal Utility</h4>
<p><strong>Marginal Utility</strong> – The change in total utility that results from a one unit increase in the quantity of the good consumed.<br>
Marginal utility is positive but it diminished as the quantity of a good consumed increases<br>
<em>Positive Marginal Utility</em> – The things people enjoy and want more of have a positive marginal utility, some things such as polluted air have negative marginal utility, meaning people want less of it<br>
<strong>Note</strong> that marginal utility is equal to the slope of the total utility curve<br>
<strong>Principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility</strong> – The tendency for marginal utility to decrease as the consumption of the good increases.</p>
<h2 id="utility-maximizing-choices">Utility Maximizing Choices</h2>
<p>Consumers want to get the most utility possible from their limited resources. They want to make the choice to maximize their utility. To discover this choice, consider their budget and preferences to find the point on the budget line giving the consumer the maximum attainable utility.</p>
<h3 id="a-spreadsheet-solution">A Spreadsheet Solution</h3>
<p>A step by step way of calculating the best choice</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>These are the points on the budget line</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find the Total Utility for Each Just Affordable Combination</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Add the utility from the choices present at each point on the budget line</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Find the consumer Equilibrium</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is point that gives the highest total utility</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choosing-at-the-margin">Choosing at the Margin</h3>
<h4 id="marginal-utility-per-dollar">Marginal Utility Per Dollar</h4>
<p><strong>Marginal Utility Per Dollar</strong> – the marginal utiltiy from a good that results from spending one more dollar on it<br>
Call the marginal utility from good ‘x’ MU<sub>x</sub> and the price of good ‘x’ P<sub>x</sub><br>
Then the marginal utility per dollar is equal to MU<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>x</sub><br>
By comparing the marginal utility per dollar from all goods that a person buys we can determine whether the budget has been allocated in a way maximizing total utility.</p>
<h4 id="utility-maximizing-rule">Utility Maximizing Rule</h4>
<p>A consumers total utility is maximzed by following the following rule</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend all available income</li>
<li>Equalize the marginal utility per dollar for all goods</li>
</ul>
<p>If the marginal gain from an action <em>exceeds</em> the marginal loss take the action.</p>
<h2 id="predictions-of-marginal-utility-theory">Predictions of Marginal Utility Theory</h2>
<p>All of the following are predictions of marginal utility theory</p>
<ul>
<li>The law of demand</li>
<li>A fall in the price of a substitute of a good decreases the demand for the good</li>
<li>For a normal good an income increase will increase demand</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-fall-in-the-price-of-good-x">A Fall in the Price of Good x</h3>
<p>This will change the marginal utility per dollar. This will not increase the marginal utility <em>but</em> it will decrease since the price of the good decreased the ‘per dollar’ part will decrease, increasing the overall marginal utility per dollar. This will then increase the amount of good x the consumer can consume before hitting their budget line, increasing demand for good x.<br>
This has the effect of moving down the demand curve ( higher quantity purchased at a lower cost)</p>
<h4 id="a-change-in-the-quantity-demanded">A change in the quantity demanded</h4>
<p>When the price dropped of good x it increases the quantity of the good demanded by a consumer. This is reflected by a movement along a demand curve.<br>
The demand curve traces the quantities that maximize utility at each price, with all other influences remaining the same.<br>
Utility maximization with diminishing marginal utility implies the law of demand.</p>
<h4 id="a-change-in-demand">A Change in Demand</h4>
<p>The decrease in the quantity of good ‘y’ purchased as a result of the price drop of good ‘x’ is a change in demand for good y. This change in demand is illustrated by a shift in the demand curve of good y. If the demand curve shifts left the two goods are substitutes, and if it shifted rightwards they are complements.</p>
<h3 id="a-rise-in-the-price-of-good-y">A Rise in the Price of Good Y</h3>
<p>This will in general have the opposite effect of a fall in the price.</p>
<h3 id="a-rise-in-income">A Rise in Income</h3>
<p>With a larger income the demand for normal goods increases and decreases for inferior goods<br>
This has the effect of shifting the demand curve to the right. ( price stays the same but quantity purchases increased.</p>
<h3 id="the-paradox-of-value">The Paradox of Value</h3>
<p>The price of water is low and the price of diamonds is high, while water is valuable for life and diamonds are not. How can water be so cheap in comparison to diamonds? This is known as the <em>Paradox of Value</em> and can be answered by the Theory of Marginal Utility.</p>
<h4 id="the-paradox-resolved">The Paradox Resolved</h4>
<p>The paradox is resolved by consider total <em>utility</em> vs <em>marginal</em> utility. The total utility gained from water is enormous, but the more water consumed the less marginal utility we gain from it.</p>
<p>We use so much water that the marginal utility (the benefit) gained from it is extremely small.<br>
Diamonds, however, have a small total utility relative to water, but we consume so few diamonds that its marginal utility is extremely high!<br>
By maximizing your total utility, you have allocated your income in a way that makes all marginal utilities of every good <em>equal</em>. This equality must therefore hold for diamonds AND water! Diamonds have a high price and high marginal utility, while water has a low price and a small marginal utility.</p>
<h4 id="value-and-customer-surplus">Value and Customer Surplus</h4>
<p>Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the total amount that consumers are  <strong>willing and able to pay</strong> for a good or service (indicated by the demand curve) and the total amount that they actually do pay (i.e. the market price).</p>
<p>The concept of utility helps economists to make predictions about consumption choices. It helps economists understand why people buy more of a good or service when its price falls and why people buy more of most goods when their incomes increase. It also resolves the paradox of value</p>
<h2 id="new-ways-of-explaining-consumer-choices">New Ways of Explaining Consumer Choices</h2>
<h3 id="behavioural-economics">Behavioural Economics</h3>
<p>Behavioural Economics studies the ways in which limts on the human brain’s ability to compute and implement rational decisions influences economic behaviour – both the decisions that paople make and the consequences of those decisions for the way the markets work.</p>
<p>It works by observing behaviour, looking for anomolies and then tries to account for these anomolies with ideas developed by psychologists.</p>
<p>Instead of being rational utility maximizers, people are assumed to have three impediments that prevent rational choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bounded Rationality</li>
<li>Bounded Willpower</li>
<li>Bounded Self Interest</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bounded-rationality">Bounded Rationality</h4>
<p>Rationality limited by the computing power of the brain.<br>
Faced with uncertainty people may use rules of thumb, other’s opinions, and gut instinct.</p>
<h4 id="bounded-willpower">Bounded Willpower</h4>
<p>The less-then-perfect willpower that prevents us from making a decision that we know, at the time of implementing that decision that we will later regret.</p>
<h4 id="bounded-self-interest">Bounded Self Interest</h4>
<p>The limted self-interest that results in sometimes suppressing our own interests to help others.<br>
i.e. donating to a charity and therefore losing out on going to some movies.</p>
<h4 id="the-endowment-effect">The Endowment Effect</h4>
<p>The tendency for people to value something more highly simply because they own it.</p>
<h3 id="neuroeconomics">NeuroEconomics</h3>
<p>Neuroeconomics is the study of the human brain when a person makes an econmoic decision.</p>
